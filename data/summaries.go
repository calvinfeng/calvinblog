		Year:     2019,
		Month:    10,
		Title:    "First Month",
		Subtitle: "Establishing a Routine For Myself",
		Body: `This is my first month of recording myself. I worked on couple important bucket list-item song,
		Wonderful Tonight, Now & Forever, and Perfect. Wonderful Tonight has a beautiful lick that gives me an early
		glimpse into string bending technique. Now & Forever is technically challenging to me on acoustic because all I
		ever learned was strumming basic chords.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2019,
		Month:    11,
		Title:    "Fetch Band",
		Subtitle: "My Attempt to Start a Band",
		Body: `Actually, it's just Steve and me. We started to jam together. It's actually a very lucky thing for
		a guitarist to play with a drummer. In most cases, guitarists struggle to find a drummer/percussionist. We played
		couple songs together and decided to focus on 21 Guns first because it's a beginner friendly song, mostly power
		chords and only 1 note that requires bending.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2019,
		Month:    12,
		Title:    "Christmas",
		Subtitle: "Holiday Slacking Off",
		Body: `Well, I received a Les Paul for my birthday! I've been working on Blues lesson from Justin Guitar and
		general music theory. I continued with my regular practice routines, i.e. scales, barre chords, improvisation,
		and chord changes.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2020,
		Month:    1,
		Title:    "Scarlet Solo",
		Subtitle: "Dedicated Guitar Recording",
		Body: `I bought an audio interface and Bias FX for simulated software amplification. This allowed me to record
		my practices with greater details, easier to spot mistakes. Steve and I also completed a full recording of 21 Guns.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2020,
		Month:    2,
		Title:    "AT2020",
		Subtitle: "New Condenser Microphone",
		Body: `I got my AT2020 and became obsessed with vocal recording and audio mixing. I made multiple recordings for
		my favorite songs and improved upon previously recorded 21 Guns sound tracks. Near the end of the month,
		Fetchers decided to put together a music group. Steve and I started working on Back in Black.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2020,
		Month:    3,
		Title:    "Back in Black & Yesterday",
		Subtitle: "Focusing on Rhythm",
		Body: `I worked with Steve to learn the Back in Black's groove. It's a tricky song because my guitar part
		generally strums on the off beats. The chord voicing wasn't difficult but it required me to palm mute on all the
		power chords. The riff that involves moving my left hand quickly also took some efforts to pick up. In my spare
		time, I picked up Beatles' Yesterday because it's a simple yet beautiful tune.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2020,
		Month:    4,
		Title:    "Back in Black",
		Subtitle: "Focusing on Solo",
		Body: `For this month, majority of my effort is to learn the Angus Young's solo in Back in Black. This is
		particularly challenging to me because it's the fastest solo I've ever attended to learn. The progress was
		painfully slow but was extremely rewarding and beneficial to my development. In my relax time, I played a bit of
		Beyond's solo. It helped me to stay sane.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2020,
		Month:    5,
		Title:    "Beyond",
		Subtitle: "Collection of My Childhood Favorite Solos",
		Body: `My objective is quite simple. I want to learn the iconic solos from all of my favorite Beyond songs
		from childhood. It won't be perfect the first time but at least I should get them under my fingers and then I
		will resume back to Back in Black solo to perfect it.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2020,
		Month:    6,
		Title:    "More Beyond",
		Subtitle: "Collection of My Childhood Favorite Solos",
		Body: `I guess one month was not enough for me to learn all the favorite solos. I am continuing the effort
		this month to perfect the performance of each solo. I also just recently bought a new American made Fender
		Stratocaster. I am adapting my fingers around the neck. In terms of speed, Stratocaster neck is noticeably faster 
		than Les Paul neck due to the longer scale length.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2020,
		Month:    7,
		Title:    "The Final Countdown Part 1",
		Subtitle: "The SpongeBob Solo and Microwave Commercial",
		Body: `After working through Beyond's solos, I have the confidence to tackle my next favorite solo from the band 
		Europe. This is the song we used to sing in AP Calculus before the class starts. I always thought this is 
		the example of shredding. However, now I look at it. I think it's more of an introduction to shredding. It is a 
		great opportunity to introduce myself to sweep picking. The Final Countdown solo has a mini sweep pick across 2 strings. 
		This is not going to be easy but I am dead set on this goal.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2020,
		Month:    8,
		Title:    "The Final Countdown Part 2",
		Subtitle: "Consistent and Persistent",
		Body: `One month was simply not enough for me to develop the finger strength and dexterity for this song. I am
		continuing my practice, pushing from 100 beats per minute to the original tempo at 117 beats per minute. 
        Honestly, it's been getting quite repetitive. But I am definitely not giving up. If time is what it takes, so be
		it.`,
	},
	{
		Year:     2020,
		Month:    9,
		Title:    "The Final Countdown Part 3",
		Subtitle: "Keep Pushing",
		Body: `The last 10% speed is ridiculously difficult. This is going to be my third month on The Final Countdown
		solo. I am so determined to execute this song as flawless as possible at its original tempo. It's getting really
		close.`,
	},
